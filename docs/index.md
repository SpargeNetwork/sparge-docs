# Sparge

Sparge is an experimental, JavaScript-native blockchain playground.

It exists to explore what happens when communities, code, and AI come together —
without pretending to be a financial system or an investment.

Sparge is **desktop-first**, **community-driven**, and intentionally minimal.
Things may change. Things may break. That is part of the experiment.

## What is Sparge?

Sparge is a blockchain built in JavaScript, designed as a playground rather than a product.

It focuses on:
- fast iteration
- clear and readable code
- community experimentation
- tooling that feels closer to a launcher or game client than to a bank

Sparge does not try to solve “everything”.
It exists to see what is possible — and what is not.

---

## What Sparge is not

Sparge is **not**:
- an investment
- a promise of value
- a bank or a fiat-backed system
- a “next generation” replacement for existing chains

There are no guarantees about:
- uptime
- permanence
- future direction
- exchange listings

If you are looking for certainty, Sparge is not for you.

---

## How the network works (high level)

Sparge is kept online by **community-run nodes**.

- **Observer nodes** help sync, store, and relay blockchain data
- Block production follows fixed intervals
- There is no proof-of-work mining

Running a node is voluntary.
Participation is about keeping the network available, not extracting rewards.

---

## Wallet-first experience

Sparge is designed around a **desktop wallet**:

- keys are generated and stored locally
- transactions are signed locally
- optional observer mode can run inside the same app

Sparge never stores your keys.
If you lose them, they cannot be recovered.

---

## Built with AI assistance

Sparge is built with heavy AI assistance.

AI is used as a tool for:
- design exploration
- implementation support
- iteration and documentation

AI is not an autonomous maintainer.
Human decisions still define direction and limits.

---

## Status

Sparge is early-stage and experimental.

Expect:
- breaking changes
- incomplete features
- evolving documentation

This is intentional.

---

## Get involved

If you are curious rather than certain, you can:
- run an **Observer Node**
- explore the **Wallet**
- read the **Manifesto**
- experiment, break things, and learn

Sparge is not about arriving.
It is about exploring.
